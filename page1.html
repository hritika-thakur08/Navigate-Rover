<p style="color:white;font-size: 40px"><b>The Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), also called Mangalyaan ("Mars-craft", from Sanskrit: मंगल mangala, "Mars" and यान yāna, "craft, vehicle") is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. <br>It was launched on 5 November 2013 by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).It is India's first interplanetary mission[15] and it made it the fourth space agency to reach Mars, after Roscosmos, NASA, and the European Space Agency.It made India the first Asian nation to reach Martian orbit and the first nation in the world to do so on its maiden attempt.</b>

The Mars Orbiter Mission probe lifted-off <i>f</i>rom the First <del>lunch</del>Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (Sriharikota Range SHAR), Andhra Pradesh, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle<mark> (PSLV) </mark>rocket C25 at 09:08 UTC on 5 November 2013.The launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 October 2013.The MOM probe spent about a month in Earth orbit, where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-Mars injection on 30 November 2013 (UTC).After a 298-day transit to Mars, it was put into Mars orbit on 24 September 2014.

<h2 style="font-size: 40px;border:solid;background-color: blue;color: white"id="USA">MAVEN</h2>
<p style="color: yellow;font-size: 30px">Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) is a spacecraft developed by NASA that went into orbit around Mars to study the planet's atmosphere. Mission goals include determining how the atmosphere and water, presumed to have once been substantial, were lost over time.

MAVEN was launched aboard an Atlas V launch vehicle at the beginning of the first launch window on November 18, 2013. Following the first engine burn of the Centaur second stage, the vehicle coasted in low Earth orbit for 27 minutes before a second Centaur burn of 5 minutes to insert it into a heliocentric Mars transit orbit.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 40px;border:solid;background-color: blue;color: white"id="China">Yinghuo-1</h2>
<p style="color: yellow;font-size: 30px">Yinghuo-1 (simplified Chinese: 萤火一号; traditional Chinese: 螢火一號; pinyin: Yínghuǒ yī hào) was a Chinese Mars-exploration space probe, intended to be the first Chinese spacecraft to orbit Mars. It was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, on 8 November 2011, along with the Russian Fobos-Grunt sample return spacecraft, which was intended to visit Mars' moon Phobos.The 115-kg (250-lb) Yinghuo-1 probe was intended by the CNSA to orbit Mars for about two years,studying the planet's surface, atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetic field.Shortly after launch, Fobos-Grunt was expected to perform two burns to depart Earth orbit bound for Mars. However, these burns did not take place, leaving both probes stranded in orbit. On 17 November 2011, Chinese state media reported that Yinghuo-1 had been declared lost by the CNSA.After a period of orbital decay, Yinghuo-1 and Fobos-Grunt underwent destructive re-entry on 15 January 2012, finally disintegrating over the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 40px;border:solid;background-color: blue;color: white"id="Schiaparelli EDM lander">EUROPE</h2>
<p style="color: yellow;font-size: 30px">Schiaparelli EDM (Italian: [skjapaˈrɛlli]) was a failed Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module (EDM) of the ExoMars programme—a joint mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos.It was built in Italy and was intended to test technology for future soft landings on the surface of Mars.It also had a limited but focused science payload that would have measured atmospheric electricity on Mars and local meteorological conditions.

Launched together with the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) on 14 March 2016, Schiaparelli attempted a landing on 19 October 2016. Telemetry signals from Schiaparelli, monitored in real time by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope in India (and confirmed by Mars Express), were lost about one minute from the surface during the final landing stages.On 21 October 2016, NASA released an image by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showing what appears to be the lander's crash site. The telemetry data accumulated and relayed by ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express were used to investigate the failure modes of the landing technology employed.</p>
